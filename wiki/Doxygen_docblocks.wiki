= Documenting the code =

   = Special documentation blocks =
  A special documentation block is a C or C++ style comment block with some additional markings, so doxygen knows it is a piece of documentation that needs to end up in the generated documentation. For Python code there is a different comment convention, which can be found in section  [Doxygen_docblocks Special documentation blocks in Python]  
 For each code item there are two types of descriptions, which together form the documentation: a  _brief_  description and  _detailed_  description, both are optional. Having more than one brief or detailed description however, is not allowed.
 As the name suggest, a brief description is a short one-liner, whereas the detailed description provides longer, more detailed documentation.
 There are several ways to mark a comment block as a detailed description:  
 For the brief description there are also several posibilities:  
 As you can see doxygen is quite flexible. The following however is not legal
 
{{{
//! Brief description, which is
//! really a detailed description since it spans multiple lines.
/*! Oops, another detailed description!
 */
}}}
 because doxygen only allows one brief and one detailed description.
 Furthermore, if there is one brief description before a declaration and one before a definition of a code item, only the one before the  _declaration_  will be used. If the same situation occurs for a detailed description, the one before the  _definition_  is preferred and the one before the declaration will be ignored.
 Here is an example of a documented piece of C++ code using the Qt style:   
 The one-line comments contain a brief description, whereas the multi-line comment blocks contain a more detailed description.
 The brief descriptions are included in the member overview of a class, namespace or file and are printed using a small italic font (this description can be hidden by setting BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC to  `NO`  in the config file). By default the brief descriptions become the first sentence of the detailed descriptions (but this can be changed by setting the REPEAT_BRIEF tag to  `NO`  ). Both the brief and the detailed descriptions are optional for the Qt style.
 By default a JavaDoc style documentation block behaves the same way as a Qt style documentation block. This is not according the JavaDoc specification however, where the first sentence of the documentation block is automatically treated as a brief description. To enable this behaviour you should set JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF to YES in the configuration file. If you enable this option and want to put a dot in the middle of a sentence without ending it, you should put a backslash and a space after it. Here is an example: 
{{{
/** Brief description (e.g.\ using only a few words). Details follow. */
}}}
 Here is the same piece of code as shown above, this time documented using the JavaDoc style and JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF set to YES:   
 Unlike most other documentation systems, doxygen also allows you to put the documentation of members (including global functions) in front of the  _definition_  . This way the documentation can be placed in the source file instead of the header file. This keeps the header file compact, and allows the implementer of the members more direct access to the documentation. As a compromise the brief description could be placed before the declaration and the detailed description before the member definition.
    = Putting documentation after members =
  If you want to document the members of a file, struct, union, class, or enum, and you want to put the documentation for these members inside the compound, it is sometimes desired to place the documentation block after the member instead of before. For this purpose you have to put an additional < marker in the comment block. Note that this also works for the parameters of a function.
 Here are some examples: 
{{{
int var; /*!< Detailed description after the member */
}}} This block can be used to put a Qt style detailed documentation block  _after_  a member. Other ways to do the same are: 
{{{
int var; /**< Detailed description after the member */
}}} or 
{{{
int var; //!< Detailed description after the member
         //!<
}}} or 
{{{
int var; ///< Detailed description after the member
         ///<
}}}
 Most often one only wants to put a brief description after a member. This is done as follows: 
{{{
int var; //!< Brief description after the member
}}} or 
{{{
int var; ///< Brief description after the member
}}}
 Note that these blocks have the same structure and meaning as the special comment blocks in the previous section only the < indicates that the member is located in front of the block instead of after the block.
 Here is an example of the use of these comment blocks:   
  
    = Documentation at other places =
  So far we have assumed that the documentation blocks are always located  _in_    _front_  of the declaration or definition of a file, class or namespace or in front or after one of its members. Although this is often comfortable, there may sometimes be reasons to put the documentation somewhere else. For documenting a file this is even required since there is no such thing as "in front of a file".
 Doxygen allows you to put your documentation blocks practically anywhere (the exception is inside the body of a function or inside a normal C style comment block).
 The price you pay for not putting the documentation block directly before (or after) an item is the need to put a structural command inside the documentation block, which leads to some duplication of information. So in practice you should  _avoid_  the use of structural commands  _unless_  other requirements force you to do so.
 Structural commands (like all other commands) start with a backslash (  `\`  ), or an at-sign (  `@`  ) if you prefer JavaDoc style, followed by a command name and one or more parameters. For instance, if you want to document the class  `Test`  in the example above, you could have also put the following documentation block somewhere in the input that is read by doxygen: 
{{{
/*! \class Test
    \brief A test class.

    A more detailed class description.
*/
}}}
 Here the special command  `\class`  is used to indicate that the comment block contains documentation for the class  `Test`  . Other structural commands are: 
 #   `\struct`  to document a C-struct.

 #   `\union`  to document a union.

 #   `\enum`  to document an enumeration type.

 #   `\fn`  to document a function.

 #   `\var`  to document a variable or typedef or enum value.

 #   `\def`  to document a #define.

 #   `\typedef`  to document a type definition.

 #   `\file`  to document a file.

 #   `\namespace`  to document a namespace.

 #   `\package`  to document a Java package.

 #   `\interface`  to document an IDL interface.

 See section  [Doxygen_commands Special Commands]  for detailed information about these and many other commands.
 To document a member of a C++ class, you must also document the class itself. The same holds for namespaces. To document a global C function, typedef, enum or preprocessor definition you must first document the file that contains it (usually this will be a header file, because that file contains the information that is exported to other source files).
 Let's repeat that, because it is often overlooked: to document global objects (functions, typedefs, enum, macros, etc), you  _must_  document the file in which they are defined. In other words, there  _must_  at least be a 
{{{
/*! \file */
}}} or a 
{{{
/** @file */
}}} line in this file.
 Here is an example of a C header named  `structcmd.h`  that is documented using structural commands:   
 Because each comment block in the example above contains a structural command, all the comment blocks could be moved to another location or input file (the source file for instance), without affecting the generated documentation. The disadvantage of this approach is that prototypes are duplicated, so all changes have to be made twice! Because of this you should first consider if this is really needed, and avoid structural commands if possible. I often receive examples that contain \fn command in comment blocks which are place in front of a function. This is clearly a case where the \fn command is redundant and will only lead to problems.
    = Special documentation blocks in Python =
  For Python there is a standard way of documenting the code using so called documentation strings. Such strings are stored in  `__doc__`  and can be retrieved at runtime. Doxygen will extract such comments and assume they have to be represented in a preformatted way.
   
 Note that in this case none of doxygen's  [Doxygen_commands special commands]  are supported.
 There is also another way to document Python code using comments that start with "##". These type of comment blocks are more in line with the way documentation blocks work for the other languages supported by doxygen and this also allows the use of special commands.
 Here is the same example again but now using doxygen style comments:
   
 Since python looks more like Java than like C or C++, you should set OPTMIZE_OUTPUT_JAVA to  `YES`  in the config file.
