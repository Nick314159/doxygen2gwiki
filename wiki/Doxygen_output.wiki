= Output Formats =


The following output formats are _directly_ supported by doxygen: 
*HTML*
 Generated if `GENERATE_HTML` is set to `YES` in the configuration file.
[http://doxygen2gwiki.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Doxygen_form_0.png]
 Generated if `GENERATE_LATEX` is set to `YES` in the configuration file.
*Man pages*
 Generated if `GENERATE_MAN` is set to `YES` in the configuration file.
*RTF*
 Generated if `GENERATE_RTF` is set to `YES` in the configuration file.

Note that the RTF output probably only looks nice with Microsoft's Word 97. If you have success with other programs, please let me know.
*XML*
 Generated if `GENERATE_XML` is set to `YES` in the configuration file.

Note that the XML output is still under development.


The following output formats are _indirectly_ supported by doxygen: 
*Compressed HTML* (a.k.a. Windows 98 help)
 Generated by Microsoft's HTML Help workshop from the HTML output if `GENERATE_HTMLHELP` is set to `YES`.
*PostScript*
 Generated from the [http://doxygen2gwiki.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Doxygen_form_0.png]  output by running `make ps` in the output directory. For the best results `PDF_HYPERLINKS` should be set to `NO`.
*PDF*
 Generated from the [http://doxygen2gwiki.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Doxygen_form_0.png]  output by running `make pdf` in the output directory. In order to get hyperlinks in the PDF file, `PDF_HYPERLINKS` should be set to `YES` in the configuration file.
