= Linking to external documentation =


If your project depends on external libraries or tools, there are several reasons to not include all sources for these with every run of doxygen:

 *Parsing error* 

If any of the above apply, you can use doxygen's tag file mechanism. A tag file is basically a compact representation of the entities found in the external sources. Doxygen can both generate and read tag files.

To generate a tag file for your project, simply put the name of the tag file after the  [Doxygen_config_1cfg_generate_tagfile GENERATE_TAGFILE]   option in the configuration file.

To combine the output of one or more external projects with your own project you should specify the name of the tag files after the  [Doxygen_config_1cfg_tagfiles TAGFILES]   option in the configuration file.

A tag file does not contain information about where the external documentation is located. This could be a directory or an URL. So when you include a tag file you have to specify where the external documentation is located. There are two ways to do this:  *Parsing error* 

 *Parsing error* 
 *Parsing error* 
 *Parsing error* 
 *Parsing error* 
In some (hopefully exceptional) cases you may have the documentation generated by doxygen, but not the sources nor a tag file. In this case you can use the  [Doxygen_doxytag_usage doxytag]   tool to extract a tag file from the generated HTML sources. Another case where you should use doxytag is if you want to create a tag file for the Qt documentation.

The tool `doxytag` depends on the particular structure of the generated output and on some special markers that are generated by doxygen. Since this type of extraction is brittle and error-prone I suggest you only use this approach if there is no alternative. The doxytag tool may even become obsolete in the future.
