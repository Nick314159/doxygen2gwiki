Although doxygen can be used in any C or C++ project, initially it was specifically designed to be used for projects that make use of Troll Tech's [http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt.html Qt toolkit] . I have tried to make doxygen `Qt-compatible'. That is: Doxygen can read the documentation contained in the Qt source code and create a class browser that looks very similar to the one that is generated by Troll Tech. Doxygen understands the C++ extensions used by Qt such as signals and slots.
Doxygen can also automatically generate links to existing documentation that was generated with Doxygen or with Qt's non-public class browser generator. For a Qt based project this means that whenever you refer to members or classes belonging to the Qt toolkit, a link will be generated to the Qt documentation. This is done independent of where this documentation is located!
