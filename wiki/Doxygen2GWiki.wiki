= Introduction =

Doxygen2GWiki is a tool which takes [http://www.doxygen.org Doxygen] generated documentation and converts it into a Google Code's Wiki markup. It can also [CommandLineParameters control subversion], adding and removing files from the repository as necessary.

= Running Doxygen2GWiki =

To run Doxygen2GWiki simply type...
{{{
doxygen2gwiki
}}}

This will look for Doxygen generated XML documentation in `doc/xml` and place the resulting code into `wiki/`.

The location of the various files can be controlled through the use of options...
{{{
doxygen2gwiki -d examples/doxygen/doc/xml -o examples/doxygen/wiki -p Example
}}}

This command will look for the XML documentation in `examples/doxygen/doc/xml` and will place the output into `examples/doxygen/wiki`. All filenames will be prefixed with `Example_` rather than the default `Doxygen_`.

= Examples =

As an example, the complete Doxygen user manual can be found [Doxygen here]. The equivalent HTML output is [http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual.html here].
