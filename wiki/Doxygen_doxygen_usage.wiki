= Doxygen usage =


Doxygen is a command line based utility. Calling `doxygen` with the `--help` option at the command line will give you a brief description of the usage of the program.
All options consist of a leading character `-` , followed by one character and one or more arguments depending on the option.
To generate a manual for your project you typically need to follow these steps:
If you have a configuration file generated with an older version of doxygen, you can upgrade it to the current version by running doxygen with the -u option.
{{{
doxygen -u <config_file>
}}}
All configuration settings in the orginal configuration file will be copied to the new configuration file. Any new options will have their default value. Note that comments that you may have added in the original configuration file will be lost.
If you want to fine-tune the way the output looks, doxygen allows you generate default style sheet, header, and footer files that you can edit afterwards:
