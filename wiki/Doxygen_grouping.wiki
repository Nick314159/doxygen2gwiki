= Grouping =


Doxygen has three mechanisms to group things together. One mechanism works at a global level, creating a new page for each group. These groups are called  [Doxygen_grouping_1modules 'modules']   in the documentation. The second mechanism works within a member list of some compound entity, and is refered to as a  [Doxygen_grouping_1memgroup 'member groups']  . For  [Doxygen_commands_1cmdpage pages]   there is a third grouping mechanism referred to as  [Doxygen_grouping_1subpaging subpaging]  .
