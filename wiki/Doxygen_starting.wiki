The executable{{{doxygen}}}is the main program that parses the sources and generates the documentation. See section [Doxygen_doxygen_usage] for more detailed usage information.

The executable{{{doxytag}}}is only needed if you want to generate references to external documentation (i.e. documentation that was generated by doxygen) for which you do not have the sources. See section [Doxygen_doxytag_usage] for more detailed usage information.

Optionally, the executable{{{doxywizard}}}can be used, which is a [Doxygen_doxywizard_usage] for editing the configuration file that is used by doxygen and for running doxygen in a graphical environment. For Mac OS X doxywizard will be started by clicking on the Doxygen application icon.

The following figure shows the relation between the tools and the flow of information between them (it looks complex but that's only because it tries to be complete):
