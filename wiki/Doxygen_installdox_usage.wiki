= Installdox usage =

 Installdox is a perl script that is generated by doxygen whenever tag files are used (See  `TAGFILES`  in section  [Doxygen_config External reference options]  ) or the search engine is enabled (See  `SEARCHENGINE`  in section  [Doxygen_config Search engine options]  ). The script is located in the same directory where the HTML files are located.
 Its purpose is to set the location of the external documentation for each tag file and to set the correct links to the search engine at install time.
 Calling  `installdox`  with option  *-h*  at the command line will give you a brief description of the usage of the program.
 The following options are available:  Optionally a list of HTML files may be given. These files are scanned and modified if needed. If this list is omitted all files in the current directory that end with  ``  .html are used.
 The  `installdox`  script is unique for each generated class browser in the sense that it `knows' what tag files are used. It will generate an error if the  *-l*  option is missing for a tag file or if an invalid tag file is given.
