= Graphs and diagrams =


Doxygen has built-in support to generate inheritance diagrams for C++ classes.
Doxygen can use the "dot" tool from graphviz 1.5 to generate more advanced diagrams and graphs. Graphviz is an "open-sourced", cross-platform graph drawing toolkit and can be found at [http://www.graphviz.org/ http://www.graphviz.org/] 
If you have the "dot" tool available in the path, you can setto `YES` in the configuration file to let doxygen use it.
Doxygen uses the "dot" tool to generate the following graphs:
The elements in the class diagrams in HTML and RTF have the following meaning:
The elements in the class diagram in$\mbox{\LaTeX}$have the following meaning:
The elements in the graphs generated by the dot tool have the following meaning:
Here are a couple of header files that together show the various diagrams that doxygen can generate:
