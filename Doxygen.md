# Introduction #


Doxygen is a documentation system for C++, C, Java, Objective-C, Python, IDL (Corba and Microsoft flavors) and to some extent PHP, C#, and D.

It can help you in three ways:
  1. It can generate an on-line documentation browser (in HTML) and/or an off-line reference manual (in ![http://doxygen2gwiki.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Doxygen_form_0.png](http://doxygen2gwiki.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Doxygen_form_0.png) ) from a set of documented source files. There is also support for generating output in RTF (MS-Word), PostScript, hyperlinked PDF, compressed HTML, and Unix man pages. The documentation is extracted directly from the sources, which makes it much easier to keep the documentation consistent with the source code.
> 2. You can configure  doxygen to extract the code structure from undocumented source files. This is very useful to quickly find your way in large source distributions. You can also visualize the relations between the various elements by means of include dependency graphs, inheritance diagrams, and collaboration diagrams, which are all generated automatically.
> 3. You can even `abuse' doxygen for creating normal documentation (as I did for this manual).


Doxygen is developed under [Linux](http://www.linux.org) and Mac OS X, but is set-up to be highly portable. As a result, it runs on most other Unix flavors as well. Furthermore, executables for Windows are available.

This manual is divided into three parts, each of which is divided into several sections.

The first part forms a user manual:
  * Section [Installation](Doxygen_install.md)  discusses how to [download](http://www.doxygen.org/download.html), compile and install doxygen for your platform.
  * Section [Getting started](Doxygen_starting.md)  tells you how to generate your first piece of documentation quickly.
  * Section [Documenting the code](Doxygen_docblocks.md)  demonstrates the various ways that code can be documented.
  * Section [Lists](Doxygen_lists.md)  show various ways to create lists.
  * Section [Grouping](Doxygen_grouping.md)  shows how to group things together.
  * Section [Including formulas](Doxygen_formulas.md)  shows how to insert formulas in the documentation.
  * Section [Graphs and diagrams](Doxygen_diagrams.md)  describes the diagrams and graphs that doxygen can generate.
  * Section [Preprocessing](Doxygen_preprocessing.md)  explains how doxygen deals with macro definitions.
  * Section [Automatic link generation](Doxygen_autolink.md)  shows how to put links to files, classes, and members in the documentation.
  * Section [Output Formats](Doxygen_output.md)  shows how to generate the various output formats supported by doxygen.
  * Section [Linking to external documentation](Doxygen_external.md)  explains how to let doxygen create links to externally generated documentation.
  * Section [Frequently Asked Questions](Doxygen_faq.md)  gives answers to frequently asked questions.
  * Section [Troubleshooting](Doxygen_trouble.md)  tells you what to do when you have problems.


The second part forms a reference manual:

  * Section [Features](Doxygen_features.md)  presents an overview of what doxygen can do.
  * Section [Doxygen History](Doxygen_history.md)  shows what has changed during the development of doxygen and what still has to be done.
  * Section [Doxygen usage](Doxygen_doxygen_usage.md)  shows how to use the `doxygen` program.
  * Section [Doxytag usage](Doxygen_doxytag_usage.md)  shows how to use the `doxytag` program.
  * Section [Doxywizard usage](Doxygen_doxywizard_usage.md)  shows how to use the `doxywizard` program.
  * Section [Installdox usage](Doxygen_installdox_usage.md)  shows how to use the `installdox` script that is generated by doxygen if you use tag files.
  * Section [Configuration](Doxygen_config.md)  shows how to fine-tune doxygen, so it generates the documentation you want.
  * Section [Special Commands](Doxygen_commands.md)  shows an overview of the special commands that can be used within the documentation.
  * Section [HTML Commands](Doxygen_htmlcmds.md)  shows an overview of the HTML commands that can be used within the documentation.
  * Section [XML Commands](Doxygen_xmlcmds.md)  shows an overview of the C# style XML commands that can be used within the documentation.


The third part provides information for developers:

  * Section [Doxygen's Internals](Doxygen_arch.md)  gives a global overview of how doxygen is internally structured.
  * Section [Perl Module output format documentation](Doxygen_perlmod.md)  shows how to use the PerlMod output.
  * Section [Internationalization](Doxygen_langhowto.md)  explains how to add support for new output languages.

# User examples #


Doxygen supports a number of [output formats](Doxygen_output.md)  where HTML is the most popular one. I've gathered   of real-life projects using doxygen.

These are part of a larger   If you know other projects, let me know and I'll add them.

# Future work #


Although doxygen is used successfully by a lot of people already, there is always room for improvement. Therefore, I have compiled a   of possible and/or requested enhancements.

Thanks go to:
  * Malte Zöckler and Roland Wunderling, authors of DOC++. The first version of doxygen borrowed some code of an old version of DOC++. Although I have rewritten practically all code since then, DOC++ has still given me a good start in writing doxygen.
  * All people at Troll Tech, for creating a beautiful GUI Toolkit (which is very useful as a Windows/Unix platform abstraction layer :-)
  * My brother Frank for rendering the logos.
  * Harm van der Heijden for adding HTML help support.
